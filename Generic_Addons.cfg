    RESULTS
	{
	    MunSrfLanded = Mun dust can be compacted to make a fairly effective concrete analog.  It might be useful in making bases.
		MunSrfLanded = The upper layers of the Mun's surface - while geologically stable - appear to shift randomly with the day/night cycle.  Care should be taken when placing structures on the surface to place them on as level a field as possible.
