    RESULTS
	{
	    default = We managed to make a concrete slap type thing.  Mostly.
	    MunSrfLanded = Mun dust can be compacted to make a fairly effective concrete analog.  It might be useful in making bases.
		MunSrfLanded = The upper layers of the Mun's surface - while geologically stable - appear to shift randomly with the day/night cycle.  Care should be taken when placing structures on the surface to place them on as level a field as possible.
        MunSrfLanded = Building a base on the Mun is definitely possible.

		KerbinSrfLanded = We have successfully learned how to build on Kerbin.
		KerbinSrfLanded = You know, we didn't really need an air-tight rocket capable of going into space to do this.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Kerbin's surface actually makes a pretty poor building material.  To much organic matter.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Cutting up the ground appears to make a good building material.  Until it heats up.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Igloos are the future.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The local surface material is very difficult to turn into solid building material.  Maybe we'd have more luck in space?

// This is a high mass experiment - at least the mass of a docking port plus some extra.  Maybe more.
// It should also be fairly expensive.
// You could limit it to being present if a mod that includes inflatable structures is install, but that includes most of WildBlueIndustries, UmbraSpaceIndustries, and several others.

	title = Inflatable Habitation Study

    RESULTS
    {
        default = It's possible to live in a giant inflatable balloon.  Who'd have thought?
        KerbinSrfLanded = It's hard to get the test module to inflate here.  It's designed for vacuum.
        KerbinInSpace = Module deployed as designed.
        KerbinInSpace = Note: Keeping the module in storage for extended periods has detrimental effects on it's ability to inflate.
        KerbinInSpace = Module durability appears good - no leaks found so far.
        KerbinInSpace = Despite the success of the design, Jeb has voiced concerns over living in a 'giant balloon.'
        KerbinInSpace = Radiation levels seem to be lower in the inflatable module than in the rest of the ship.  Dr. Wernher believes this to be a reduction in Bremsstrahlung radiation.  Bob isn't so sure.
        MunSrfLanded = Inflatable modules on the surface of the Mun!  What a thought!
        MunSrfLanded = Deployment test results are mixed.  Standard deployment went fine, but attempting to use munar regolith for extra shielding caused collapse of the module.
        MunSrfLanded = Walking around, looking at the outside of the test module, brings a certain thoughtful state of mind.  The though being: 'Do I really want to live in a balloon?'
