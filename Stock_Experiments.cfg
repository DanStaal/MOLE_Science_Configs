    RESULTS
	{
	    default = We managed to make a concrete slap type thing.  Mostly.
	    MunSrfLanded = Mun dust can be compacted to make a fairly effective concrete analog.  It might be useful in making bases.
		MunSrfLanded = The upper layers of the Mun's surface - while geologically stable - appear to shift randomly with the day/night cycle.  Care should be taken when placing structures on the surface to place them on as level a field as possible.

		KerbinSrfLanded = We have successfully learned how to build on Kerbin.
		KerbinSrfLanded = You know, we didn't really need an air-tight rocket capable of going into space to do this.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Kerbin's surface actually makes a pretty poor building material.  To much organic matter.
		KerbinSrfLandedTundra = Cutting up the ground appears to make a good building material.  Until it heats up.
		KerbinSrfLandedIceCaps = Igloos are the future.
		KerbinSrfSplashed = The local surface material is very difficult to turn into solid building material.  Maybe we'd have more luck in space?
