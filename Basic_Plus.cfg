	title = Space Adaption Study

	description = This study will investigate the physiological and psychological effects of microgravity on the kerbal body.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've gained some more insight on how the kerbal body is affected by microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = Results show a loss of muscle mass and strength, especially in the lower extremities.
		KerbinInSpace = Bone density appears to decrease with prolonged exposure to microgravity. Kerbals should exercise regularly to maintain their health.
		KerbinInSpace = Fluids tend to pool in the head and torso.
		KerbinInSpace = Researchers note a performance decrease in the cardiovascular system and a weakened immune system. Recommend regular exercise.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals prefer solid foods and ice cream to eating pastes from tubes.

		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Increased levels of cellular damage is noted further from Kerbin's magnetosphere.  Increasing radiation shielding is recommended.  As a side note, Bill now glows slightly.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = High orbit does not appear to significantly change effects to bone and muscle density vs. low orbit.
		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Kerbals like looking at the stars.  Could we get a window?

		MunSrfLanded = Muscle mass and strength loss is mitigated by the 0.166g gravitational field on Mun's surface.  But only slightly.
		MunSrfLanded = Researchers note an unexpected increase in performance of the cardiovascular system from living on the Mun.  As a side note, jumping in low gravity is fun.
		MunSrfLanded = A strange burning smell has been traced to the dust tracked in by returning EVAs.  Bob has advised everyone to not panic - it appears to be the scent of Mun dust, and does not mean there's an actual fire.

	id = WBIPowerToolsEvaluation
	title = Power Tools Evaluation

	description = What happens if you try to turn a screwdriver in space? The Power Tools Evaluation will evaluate different designs for power tools to find the ones that work best in a microgravity environment.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've found some tool designs that work in microgravity.
		KerbinInSpace = When turning a screwdriver in one direction, the kerbal will spin in the opposite direction. Future tools should have counter-torque systems built in.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals like hammers. They're particularly useful on cantankerous electronics.
		KerbinInSpace = Hand saws are great for zombie apocolypses but aren't so effective in space. Recommend mounting the saw to a bulkhead or other massive object.
		KerbinInSpace = Powered wirecutters should have a hand crank in case extra force is needed.
		KerbinInSpace = Kerbals like kPads. Just sayin.

		MunInSpace = Tool design does not appear to be affected by what body we orbit.  The engineers refer you to the results from Kerbin orbit.
		MinmusInSpace = In a completely unexpected finding, orbiting Minmus appears to be the same as orbiting Kerbin for designing hammers.  There have been some interesting ideas for ice cream scoops though.

		MunSrfLanded = Screwdriver designs for the Mun appear to be much easier than for microgravity.  It has to do with Bill being able to put his feet on the ground.
		MunSrfLanded = Mundust appears to be electrically charged and very fine.  Ideal for making power tools malfunction.
		// Note that the 'Y/S' is intentional, not a typo.  It's malfunctioning.
		MunSrfLanded = kPads and Mundust do *bsszt* SAVEFILE HAS BEEN CORRUPTED, REBOOT (Y/S).

	id = WBIConstructionTechniques
	title = Orbital Construction Study

	description = This experiment will test various construction methods to see what works and what doesn't in a microgravity environment. The results of this experiment will determine how future craft will be built and maintained in orbit.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = We've attempted to determine how many engineers it takes to screw in a light bulb. Results are inconclusive.
		KerbinInSpace = Research has shown that engineers can change a flat tire and repack parachutes, but can't fix broken solar panels. Go Figure.
		KerbinInSpace = Engineers have determined that a glass that could be half-full or half-empty is actually designed to be twice the required capacity.

{
	id = WBICrystalGrowth
	title = Crystal Growth Experiment

	description = How do crystals grow in space? Can they really be used for warp drives? And how do you get them to rotate in one direction, stop, and rotate in the opposite direction? This experiment will answer those questions and more.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = Crystaline structures grow quite well in space.    // Typo edit here.
		KerbinInSpace = With the right seeding, space-grown crystals can really make a difference in radio technology.
		KerbinInSpace = Protein crystals made in space can be quite useful for designing new medicines to combat diseases.
		KerbinInSpace = These crystals can be used for some New Age thingy.
		KerbinInSpace = With enough R&D, an industry could be created around high-quality protein crystal growth.
		KerbinInSpace = This experiment failed to create crystals. Instead we got near-perfect spheres. Maybe a future study could create ballbearings in space.

		KerbinInSpaceHigh = Crystals in space tend to be thinner and spikier than those grown closer to the planetary surface.

		MunSrfLanded = Crystals grown on beds of Munar regolith exhibit some fascinatingly unusual grow patterns.  Further research will be needed to see if they are useful for anything.
		MunSrfLanded = Mun's low gravity means that crystals grown on it's surface are very similar to crystals grown in space.  It might be worth setting up a production facility.

	RESULTS
	{
		default = Research shows that living and working in space is possible.

		KerbinInSpace = Research indicates that crews do not like eating food from Tasteless Ugly Biological Extruders (TUBEs).
		KerbinInSpace = kPads work just as well in space as they do on the ground.
		KerbinSrfLanded = You discover that it is possible to live and work in a giant tin can.
		KerbinSrfLanded = Research indicates that you did not go into space today.
		KerbinSrfSplashedWater = Research shows that living and working in the ocean is possible... But isn't this a SPACE research lab?
//		KerbinInSpaceGrassLands = The instrument surveys the skies in search of extraterrestrial intelligence.
//		KerbinInSpaceHighlands = The instrument tunes into a movie about a kerbal, a curved sword, and lots of electricity after each duel.
//		KerbinInSpaceMountains = The science team thinks they can watch the mountains for snowfall activity. The data might be useful for water resource management.
//		KerbinInSpaceDeserts = The sensor can be used to watch for changes in the size of the deserts.
//		KerbinInSpaceBadlands = The sensor finds a movie about a theme park with crazed killer robot cowboys.
//		KerbinInSpaceIceCaps = The sensor detects variances under the surface of the ice. Is there a landmass under that ice?
//		KerbinInSpaceShores = The sensor discovers an intriguing show about castaways out for a three hour tour who've been stranded on a deserted island.
//		KerbinInSpaceWater = The sensor shows a surprising variance as it passes over the oceans. Hinting at the varied topology deep below the waters.
//		KerbinInSpaceWater = The sensor tunes into a TV show involving a giant mottled blue submarine, a boy, and his dolphin.

        KerbinSrfSplashedWater = It is confirmed that an ocean crew recovery is possible.  Whether Kerbals can swim is still unknown.

        MunInSpace = Looking out the window at the Mun instead of Kerbin gives an awe-inspiring feeling of accomplishment on behalf of all Kerbalkind.  Or it would if we had windows.

        MunSrfLanded = Filling a giant tin can with fuel, flying it to the Mun, emptying it, and then living inside it appears to work surprisingly well.  Despite the fumes.
        MunSrfLanded = We're on the Mun!  We're on the Mun!  We're on the Mun!  *Loud noise is heard.*  Ahem.  It appears living on the Mun is possible.
